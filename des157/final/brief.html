        <section>
            <h2>comparison project 1</h2>
            <p>I am in absolute awe with the <a href="https://kentatoshikura.com/">portfolio website</a> designed by Kenta Toshikura. The website keeps most elements in a fixed position and changes the center elements as you scroll and drag. This doesn’t create a story necessarily, but it doesn’t need one because it makes you curious as each new object appears. I love how the pointer has a trailing dot and how it lights up the background oh so subtlely. The scrolling is so smooth and the numbers to the left let me know where I am. There’s even a toggle for accessibility viewing on the bottom left. It’s just great.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>comparison project 2</h2>
            <p>The second website I got inspiration from was the <a href="https://aircord.co.jp/en/">aircord website</a> also designed by Kenta Toshikura. This website is similar to the portfolio website mentioned above, however, there's specific components that I want to try to implement with my final project. The "show reel" action on the bottom left corner of the screen works well because it's not glaring, but still noticeable. It doesn't distract from the website branding. I like the minimalist design in this website as well because it feels very functional and intentional. The dark colors and interactions with the mouse are very cool too. It creates a cosmic atmosphere that I'd want to implement into my design. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>project goals</h2>
            <p>For my project, I want to follow the scrolling effect from the first website so that the user's focus remains in the center. I want to create spherical objects that represent planets with colors that match the albums from my Every Picture studio. There sphere would be in the center with a cool name next to them. The planet name could be a reference to the album name. I want to create a dark, atmospheric vibe that represents space and include minimalist touches like a link to my portfolio website, email etc. I also want to include drop down menus that explain the music and artist information.</p>

            <p>In addition, I'd like to use the "show reel" action (seen in the second website) to play music from the specific album. I'm not sure how I'd be able to play clips of the music, but I know that I'd want to include this option. Sort of like a "planetary sound track" or something fun like that. If I can, I'd also like to use my mouse for cool interaction effects. I'd like the planet to spin according to mouse direction and I also want to incorporate a stylistic pointer. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>design strategies</h2>
            <p>My plan is to use dark colors for the background of the website. I may even use the color black. Font colors will be light greys. I'd like to use a san-serif font for all the action items and if I can find a nice, elegant serif font, I'd use that for the planet names. The website's goal would be to direct the viewers attention to the middle by using colors from the album covers. Text and links will be arranged in a frame pattern surrounding the planets.  </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>interaction strategies</h2>
            <p>I'd want to keep the viewers attention in the middle. I'd do this creating a type of viewport by having items in fixed positions. Website visitors will have to scroll to view other planets. I also want to include a trailing graphic on the pointer so that it doesn't get lost behind the dark background. In addition, I'd like the mouse movements to move the planet's direction. A cool trick that I hope I can pull off, would be to create the effect of a booming speaker on the planet, once the user clicks on the "play" button for music. I want this to be a fun interaction that signals to the visitor that planet inhabitants are dancing/listening to the music they play. If a visitor stop playing the music, the planet would also stop displaying this effect.  </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>experience goals</h2>
            <p>I want the user to have fun on this website and to interact with it to learn more about the music that I love. I want to achieve this by creating stunning visuals. I'll have to figure out how to make a cool vector sphere object. I also want the user to enjoy the little interactions after performing an action, such as pressing "play" or just hovering over different parts of the screen. I also want to provide the user with small bits of information on the song that is playing and provide some information on the artist and album facts. </p>
