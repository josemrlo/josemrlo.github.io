                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>All participants were confused about the purpose of my project. They couldn’t find a satisfying story or connection to me. This was expected because I had only provided placeholder text descriptors and had no scroll function. Some feedback I received was to connect songs to my life, another was to create a fantasy story of intergalactic travels/stories about this universe. I’m thinking I want to talk about what each song means for me, why I like it so much, and share memories associated to this song. I also want to talk about the textures in the music and how they relate to the planet’s colors.</p>

                <h2>Interaction</h2>
                <p>All participants tried to scroll to see other planets but the option was unavailable. I also noticed that there was a lot of clicking around. Aside from the visuals, participants had no idea what to do on the website. This makes sense as I wasn’t completely done by this point, but it gave me information on the kinds of interactions I should include. I received suggestions for having a smooth scroll, ability to pause music, an overlay that explains the content, include drag options or arrow key functions. Planets also would look nicer if they looped in one direction instead of alternating. I will certainly include scroll and pause functions for the music. I will also think about incorporating keyboard functions as that would improve accessibility. </p>

                <h2>Layout</h2>
                <p>The initial observations of all test participants was overwhelmingly positive. The font, aesthetic, colors, and plant objects were all pleasing. I did receive some valuable feedback regarding layout. The album cover being at the bottom right corner felt obscure and separated from the main content. I noticed one participant didn't even think of clicking on it despite instructing them to do so beforehand. Based on this feedback, I decided to make the album cover bigger and to connect it to the album description. I also will improve hierarchy to make the album description more interesting.</p>
