                <p class="intp">I’ve always wondered, what makes people love video games, or on a darker note, what makes people addicted to mobile app games like words with friends, candy crush etc. Secondly, why do people spend money while playing games, even after purchasing the games themselves?</p>

                <p class="intp"><a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a> by Amir Dori highlighted some key things that make games successful in terms of popularity and monetization. The first thing that grabbed my attention was UI positions. Knowing the areas on smartphones or tablets that are easy to interact with can really help a game designer strategically place call-to-action buttons that can aid in game success. These actions include store buttons and rating buttons. Knowing the areas that are harder for users to interact with can help you with placing objects that might hurt the game’s success.</p>

                <p class="intp">Another notable thing was having characters stare at you when asking the user to complete an action, such as a rating. I thought it was another way to explore how humans are influenced by social cues. </p>

                <p class="intp">The final cool thing I learned was about the invisible skip buttons. I actually love this design in games. Letting the user know that they can step something does give the user a sense of ease, but having the skip button displayed does influence users to choose to skip. This might be from the conditioning received from pop-ups online, but I think this is a beautiful solution for getting your users to express patience and enjoy immersive experiences like short clips that move the game along.</p>
