                <p class="intp">I came across a <a href="https://l-imperatrice.cool/en/">website</a> on Awwwards.com that was created as promotional material for an album called TAKO TSUBO. The website had fun interactions with images. For starters, the landing had a glittery blue background that felt like wet paint. As my mouse hovered the background, I saw diverging ripple-like movements that delighted me.</p>

                <p class="intp">The aspect landing also included a graphic of three futuristic looking people in the center which directed my attention. The colors used create an exciting contrast. As I scrolled, I noticed other pictures. As my mouse hovered over them I was presented with cursors that had recognizable interactions such as the triangle symbolizing the “play” button. This let me know that the image would play a video had I clicked on it. </p>

                <p class="intp">Most images had their special cursors that followed a similar pattern. Some would direct me to instagram and others would direct to external pages. I really enjoyed the interactions. </p>
