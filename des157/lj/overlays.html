                <p class="intp">Overlays are a great design tool that can be used to get users to view content, complete a form, or make a decision. The only caveat is that most people get seriously annoyed by overlays/lightboxes so it’s important to think long and hard about implementing one.</p>

                <p class="intp">Here are some examples of appropriate use of overlays to view content that I could think of. If someone is scrolling at an online gallery, let’s say, like on Behance, the user might decide to click on a photo to view the entire project. An overlay would work perfectly for this because the user would be able to see more of the project without worrying about losing their place on the website. Where this gets a bit more nuanced is when a user is on someone’s website, like a person’s graphic design portfolio. Usually online portfolios only have 3-5 project; therefore, it might be best to showcase an entire project on an individual page, instead of an overlay.</p>

                <p class="intp">If a user is completing a form, there must be a way for information to be saved and user must have an option to cancel out of the form. Overlays that don’t provide this risk frustrating users and making them feel stuck. Additionally, it’s important to consider how the overlays will look on mobile devices and on zoomed-in screens. If a user needs to make a decision, the button labels need to specify the actions to be taken instead of having some generic “yes or no” options.</p>

                <p class="intp">A recent example of an overlay that I loved was presented to me after signing up for Webflow. The overlay included a tutorial guide and did not feel intrusive. Anyway, shout out to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Neilsen Norman Group</a> for helping me understand overlay use a bit more</p>
