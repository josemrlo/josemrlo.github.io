                </figure>

                <p class="intp">This image is interesting because the the displayed record is vibrant compared to the browns and dark greens surrounded by it. The image on the record is disorderly, chaotic, and playful, meanwhile the surrounding has an air of minimalism and function. There are also only two records beneath the displayed record which emphasize the importance of each (i.e. the records are drowned in archive).</p>

                <p class="intp">This image relates to the topic of my collection because it’s the first part of a sequence of displayed records that will all have the same positioning. </p>

                <p class="intp">My collection displays my attachment to this music. It was the first time I really related to an artist’s work and went into a rabbit hole discovering more about them. I also think this whole set up is funny because I don’t own a record player and still decided to buy these items because I enjoyed them that much. In fact, this record table is now used for miscellaneous objects. It’s a reminder that I’ll eventually own a record player.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>This image is about getting to know someone or falling in love. At least, that’s the story I’m creating. Some interesting aspects of this image are the artist’s style, it’s unique and all of the images feel related. The reds/pinks in each drawing make me think of a first date.</p>

                <p>The top left image seems to depict the conflict that arises after asking someone out. One person is nervous about asking. The other person is trying to decide to say yes or no. The next photo to the top right seems like a rock or an inverted lake. I actually don’t grasp the concept of this one. The bottom left is playful and makes me think of intimacy and conversation. The last one with the koi fish ties the story of a date together. It helps me imagine the environment of a date, as two people walk around a pond.</p>

                <p>The mystery is figuring out what compelled the artist to draw these pictures. Are they actually part of a story, or are they just fun practice. </p>
